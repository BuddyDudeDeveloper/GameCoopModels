    \paragraph{} This study examined how cooperativism can be applied to game development in order to create a production model for game co-ops. The goal of this study was to develop a series of strategies and actions that could be implemented on a cooperative team to create an environment conducive to democratic decision-making and creative collaboration. The Canonical Action Research methodology was used to develop a game with a small group over the course of six weeks by applying the model. In accordance with the methodology, the model was iterated upon based upon the feedback of the participants and the researcher's direct involvement. This study found that the process of democratic decision-making is more heavily dependent on facilitating the communication, alignment and collaboration necessary for it than on identifying when those decisions should occur.
